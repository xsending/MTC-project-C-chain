# MTC-project-C-chain

This program is a demonstration of how your own custom ERC20 token, the Degen Token or DGN, works after being deployed in the AVAX fuji testnet. The purpose of this program is to show how transactions are tracked in the fuji testnet by performing various different functions.

## Description

This program shows mainly the minting, burning, transferring, and redeeming of the DGN Tokens using different user accounts. Not only that, the program also shows the difference of "redeeming tokens in an in-game store" and actually burning it. Also, it uses the ERC20 standard for its functions.
